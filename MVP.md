Mindchain – MVP Document
Minimum Viable Product Specification
1. Executive Summary

Mindchain is a digital infrastructure designed to enable automated payments between machines (M2M) and between artificial intelligences (AI-AI), without direct human intervention, using a system of programmable service credits.

The Mindchain MVP aims to:

demonstrate technical feasibility

validate real, non-speculative demand

support early industrial and AI-driven use cases

Mindchain is not a speculative cryptocurrency, but a service-oriented payment and settlement layer for autonomous systems.

2. Problem Statement

Today:

Artificial intelligences cannot autonomously pay for services

IoT devices cannot execute native micropayments

Existing blockchains are often:

slow

costly

speculative

unsuitable for continuous machine-to-machine transactions

👉 There is no native economic layer for the machine economy.

3. The Mindchain Solution (MVP Scope)

Mindchain introduces:

Machine-based wallets

Programmable service credits

Lightweight, off-chain-first transactions

Periodic settlement

Auditable transaction logs

The MVP focuses on infrastructure validation, not token speculation.

4. MVP Architecture (Simplified)
Core Components

Mindchain Core

Lightweight ledger

Transaction registry

Validation rules engine

AI Wallet

Non-human wallet instance

Bound to AI agents or devices

Configurable spending policies and limits

Service Registry

List of purchasable services (APIs, compute, data)

Fixed or dynamic pricing models

API Gateway

REST / gRPC interfaces

SDK-ready endpoints for AI and IoT systems

5. MVP Features
Included

AI wallet creation

Credit allocation

AI-to-AI payments

Machine-to-machine payments

Transaction logging

Basic monitoring dashboard

Transaction simulator

Explicitly Excluded (Post-MVP)

6. MVP Use Cases
Use Case 1 – AI Purchasing AI Services

AI Agent A requests:

datasets

inference services

compute resources

AI Agent B provides the service

Mindchain executes automated settlement

Use Case 2 – Industrial IoT

Sensor generates data

Edge node processes data

Automated micropayment per operation
